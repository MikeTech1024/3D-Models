Part provides support for activity and write protect LEDS as well as the disk eject lever. Recommend printing in PETG with PLA at support interfaces. After several fevisions, the best orientation to print seems to be with the 'overhang' section on the bottom. This is the default orientation of the STL file. That allows the printer to create more accurate bore holes for the lever shaft. The bore holes are modeled at 4.35mm diameter to acommodate shrink after cooling, which should bring the actual printed diameter close to 4mm. Don't sweat this too much, just make sure the shaft is not too tight or loose. The FreeCAD project file is provided so you can more easily make changes.
